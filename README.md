### Welcome to my digital clock project created with Javascript!

As a growing software developer, I thought it was about time to build a digital clock to strengthen my abilities with Javascript. I also thought I'd use this project as an opportunity to sharpen my CSS design, and animations with several Javascript libraries in the near future.
